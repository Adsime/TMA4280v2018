Question 6:
	My tests show that Zeta for 1000 iterations give different results between single, 2 and 8 processes.

	My tests show that for mach, I get the same results for 1000 iterations and 100 iterations for singe, 2 and
	8 processes. However, if I reduce the iterations down to 10, I do observe some minor difference in the results.
	For a single process, the results are still consistent with 100 and 1000 iterations. The consistency in the single
	process results, I think might have to do with the fact that the mach method is very quick to converge.
	Earlier tests show that only 3 iterations will give a result with an estimation correct down to 3 decimal places.
	Following that argument, it makes sense that the results all do converge when the iterations go above a certain
	threshold. This threshold marks the point of where the double precision is reached. Any values of the function
	from this point will be viewed as noise and is ignored in the result.



	Zeta on the other hand takes a lot more iterations to converge. This means there has to be a higher amount of
	float operations to get the sum, thereby a higher chance of numerical inaccuracy in the floating point numbers.
